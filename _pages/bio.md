Dr.-Ing. Grigore Stamatescu is Associate Professor in the Department of Automatic Control and Industrial Informatics at the Faculty of Automatic Control and Computers, University "Politehnica" of Bucharest, Romania. He obtained his PhD degree in 2012 from the same university with a thesis on reliable wireless sensor networks for improving quality of life. This was followed by postdoctoral studies in the field of data aggregation and data fusion for multi-sensory intelligent environments. In 2015-2016 he was a Fulbright Visiting Scholar at the University of California, Merced, working on control and optimisation algorithms for building energy management, and in 2019 he received a grant of the Austrian Academy of Sciences for working on data-driven algorithms for modelling large scale manufacturing systems at the Complexity Science Hub, Vienna and the Technical University of Graz. His current research interests span the areas of networked embedded sensing, the internet of things and distributed information processing in industry, the built environment and smart city applications. In relation to his activity, he received two best paper awards, the latest at IEEE CODIT 2018 for a paper on "Wireless Sensor Network Architecture for Fog Computing", and has been involved in multiple research and technology transfer projects, including collaborations with industry partners. Recent coordinated projects include "New Dynamic Consensus Algorithms for Building Thermal Energy Management" - CONSENSYS and "Multi-protocol Gateway for Open Automation in Smart Buildings" - OPENBMS. He maintains collaborations with IT companies for consulting for r&d projects in the field of data analysis and modelling, proof-of-concept algorithm implementation, applied research reports and training. Dr. Stamatescu has published over 100 articles in international journals and conference proceedings and he is an active member of the scientific community as reviewer, committee member as well as expert for several european programs (COST, DG-REGIO). He is the organising committee co-chair of the yearly IEEE International Workshop on Systems Safety and Security (2013-2018) and editor of the Springer volume "Recent Advances in Systems Safety and Security" in the series Studies in Systems, Decision and Control. He served as the general chair of the IEEE IDAACS'2017 conference in Bucharest and in 2018 he coordinated as the lead guest editor the Journal of Sensors special issue "Sensing and Data-Driven Control for Smart Building and Smart City Systems".

Grigore Stamatescu is senior member of IEEE, currently serving as Young Professionals Affinity Group and Robotics and Automation Society (RAS) chapter chair, within the Romania Section. He is also member of ACM, the Romanian Society of Automation and Technical Informatics (SRAIT) and the IFAC TC 3.3.Telematics: Control via Communication Networks.
